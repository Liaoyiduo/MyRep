Leo is a freshman at UW-Madison. He is an international student from Chongqing
 in China. He is interested in both math and computer science, so he decides
 to double major in both majors. Leo hopes to find his way out here at
 UW-Madison after three or four years study. And hopefully he can find a
 computer science related job after graduation.
