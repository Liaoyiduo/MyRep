Leo is a freshman at UW-Madison. He is an international student from Chongqing
 in China. He is interested in both math and computer science, so he decides
 to double major in both majors. Leo hopes to find his way out here at
 UW-Madison after three or four years study. And hopefully he can find a
 computer science related job after graduation. 

Leo has loads of work experience, from internship and is truly enjoying his
 time in the United States. After being exposed to loads of cultures, he truly
 understood what being independent and being open to different cultures and
 traditions.
 
At first Leo was shocked by the freezing conditions in Madison and wasn't sure about his
decision to come to Wisconsin, but after being here for a semester he realized this was a
community he truly belonged in.

Leo spends most of his time studying but also likes to explore campus when he
has time. He was very impressed with the campus in Madison as it was unlike
anything he had seen in China. He hopes to take everything in and cherish
every experience he has at UW-Madison.
